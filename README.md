# Cryze
Cryze is a Wyze Gwell Camera Bridge that allows you to stream your Gwell based Wyze cams to locations of your choosing. Get started below or continue through the readme for more info!

## Installation/Usage
Cryze is composed of two parts: a video proxy in the form of an android application and a server responsible for coordinating the actions of the video proxy. 

### Server
The server is python based and can be installed as follows:
```bash
pip install cryze-server

# Run the server
cryze-server
```

For server options:
```bash
cryze-server -h
```

You can also access a pre-configured version of the server in a docker container:
```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d cryze-server-service
```

### Proxy
The video proxy is responsible for connecting to your Wyze Gwell based camera and sending those video frames to the cryze-server application. The video proxy waits and listens for specific wyze login info and a device id. Once the proxy has both of those it will connect to your camera and send video frames through the server on a specified websocket channel. The proxy is packaged in a Linux (tested on Ubuntu) Docker container.

To start the docker container:
```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d cryze-android-service
```

If you want to run the video proxy elsewhere, refer to [Cryze Android](https://github.com/carTloyal123/cryze-android)

## What is Cryze?
Cryze is an open-source project dedicated to providing you access to your own video camera data from Gwell-based Wyze cameras. I believe in giving you control over your camera footage without any restrictions.

Huge shoutout to [mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge](https://github.com/mrlt8/docker-wyze-bridge) for putting in tremendous work implementing numerous Wyze Cam features and streaming capabilities.
